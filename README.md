# US_Flight_Data
For this project, I created a data story in Tableau that illustrates the most relevant information 
regarding airline cancellations and delays as well as including the airports that most 
frequently experience delays.

A Kaggle dataset that tracks the on-time performance of 
US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015 was used to construct the report.
